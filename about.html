      <p>
        Hey there! Iâ€™m a 16 year old coding enthusiast navigating through Class 11. My journey with technology started way back when I was just 9 years old, and I havenâ€™t looked back since! Iâ€™ve dived deep into coding and robotics, and along the way, I got hooked on creating open-source projects that push me to learn new things every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, Iâ€™ve had some pretty memorable moments, like competing in tech competitions and even getting recognized by the Prime Minister. One of the things Iâ€™m most proud of is my internship at United Nations & Aditya Birla Group, where I gained real-world experience and worked with professionals.
      </p>

        A little while ago, I was really into game development with Godot, but recently, Iâ€™ve shifted my focus to learning Unity. This microblog is my space to motivate myself and keep track of my progress as I dive deeper into Unity. Iâ€™m always on the lookout for new challenges, so who knows where this journey will take me next!
      </p>
      <p>
        Join me as I pursue my interests, and letâ€™s create something amazing together. ðŸš€
