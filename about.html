    <section class="about">
      <p> I am a 16 year old coder from India, currently based in Singapore. I started programming when I was 9, and over the years, it has turned into something much bigger than just a hobby. From building robots for fun to pushing out open source projects, I have always learned best by doing. </p> <p> I have had the chance to represent my work at national and international competitions, and once even pitched an idea to the Prime Minister of India. I have interned with organizations like the United Nations and Aditya Birla Group, which gave me early exposure to how technology gets applied in the real world. </p> <p> Lately, I have been deep into game development. I started with Godot, moved to Unity, and now I am diving into Unreal Engine. This space is where I track my progress, share what I am building, and keep pushing myself forward, one project at a time. </p> <p> If you are into building things that challenge you and actually mean something, stick around. </p>
